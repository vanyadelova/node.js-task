# ðŸš¢ API server (in Node.js) ðŸš¢ 

## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the MSD's Backend challenge. I was expected to develop a well-structured API server (in Node.js) based on the API specification. The app should include the following features:

- **Tests**
- **Nice commit messages**
- **Readme**
- **Working code**
- **GET and POST method**
- **schemas**
- **name, speed and id properties**

It is an API to manage Shipyards with ships, stored in a Postgres database.


## Run it locally ðŸ–¥

Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vanyadelova/node.js-task.git
```
Install and start the API backend server.

```
cd node.js-task
npm install || yarn
npm start || yarn start 
```

Install project dependencies, Start the server and then open localhost:4000 in your browser.
